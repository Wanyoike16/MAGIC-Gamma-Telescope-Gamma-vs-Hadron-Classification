# MAGIC-Gamma-Telescope-Gamma-vs-Hadron-Classification
This project aims to build machine learning models that classify incoming radiation detected by the MAGIC Gamma Telescope as either originating from gamma particles (signal) or hadrons (background noise).

The classification is based on simulated data generated using CORSIKA, a Monte Carlo code for simulating extensive air showers initiated by high-energy cosmic particles.

Accurate classification is crucial in astroparticle physics to distinguish gamma rays from the background cosmic ray noise â€” helping researchers better study celestial sources like pulsars, supernova remnants, and black holes.
